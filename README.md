# WheresTheISS
Based on a practice example from "Python: The Bible". Returns the number of people currently in space according to NASA's 
open-notify api. Also returns the names of those people, as well as the craft they are currently aboard. It then shows the current 
location of the ISS, and prints the time until the next direct-overhead passing of Rocky Hill, CT.

Improvements to be made:
allow for user-input of location for the calcculation of next overhead passing

improve gui

add art that won't get me sued
